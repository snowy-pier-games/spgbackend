        <p>Kyle has been playing hobby-style board and card games ever since elementary school. Like many kids, he was
            enthralled by the collectible card game craze of the early 2000s. As time went by, his family developed the
            habit
            of frequenting the local game store, resulting in exposure to a variety of new and exciting games. Some of
            their
            early purchases included classics such as Acquire, Puerto Rico, Heroscape, Dominion, Carcassone, Ticket to
            Ride,
            and Agricola. Today, his favorites range from complex games like Great Western Trail and Suburbia to quirky
            party
            games like Balderdash and Telestrations. He currently lives in Utah with his supportive wife, and works as a
            software
            engineer for NVIDIA. Besides board gaming, his hobbies include PC gaming, LEGO, tinkering, and starting
            projects that
            he never finishes.

        <p>Bryce is the youngest brother, and also the most competetive. He loves to play any game, but especially the
            ones that require the most strategy. His favorite games are Dominion, Bohnanza, and Great Western Trail.
            He lives in Provo, Utah and is working on his masters in computer science. His hobbies include guitar,
            golf, playing games (of course), and watching movies.
