                Tattered Tales. Compete as teams to create stories to win the votes of your opposing publishing
                companies. But there’s a catch! You only have limited items available to you!</p>
            <p>Will you be able to use your random items to help create a “tattered tale”? If so, you may have what it

            <p>Tattered Tales is an award-winning storytelling game where players work in teams (called publishing
                companies) to create unique stories! As co-authors of the tale, you and your teammates must use a
                diverse set of random items to create a story that resolves a given situation. There is limited time to
                figure out how to not only use the items available to you, but also make your story immersive and
                entertaining.</p>
            <p>Players shift to new publishing companies each round, but the player who helps create the most
                captivating stories throughout the game claims the title of Master Storyteller!</p>
