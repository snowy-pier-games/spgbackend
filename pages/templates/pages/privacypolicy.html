<h2>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
<p>It is Snowy Pier Games's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
    website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.snowypiergames.com">www.snowypiergames.com</a>
    (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.snowypiergames.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
    personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
    ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
    under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
    information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and
    policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
    required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Snowy Pier Games collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
    browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
    the date and time of each visitor request. Snowy Pier Games's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
    information is to better understand how Snowy Pier Games's visitors use its website. From time to time, Snowy Pier
    Games may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
    the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Snowy Pier Games also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
    for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.snowypiergames.com blog posts. Snowy Pier Games
    only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
    personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Snowy Pier Games's websites choose to interact with Snowy Pier Games in ways that require Snowy
    Pier Games to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Snowy Pier Games
    gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
    http://www.snowypiergames.com to provide a username and email address.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
    protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you
    will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
    conditions of every site you visit.</p>

    party sites, products or services.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
    it on Snowy Pier Games's behalf or to provide services available at Snowy Pier Games's website, and (ii) that have
    agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
    located outside of your home country; by using Snowy Pier Games's website, you consent to the transfer of such
    information to them. Snowy Pier Games will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
    as described above, Snowy Pier Games discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Snowy Pier Games
    believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Snowy Pier
    Games, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of http://www.snowypiergames.com and have supplied your email address, Snowy Pier Games
    may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
    date with what's going on with Snowy Pier Games and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type
    of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
    support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
    or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Snowy Pier Games takes all measures reasonably
    necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
